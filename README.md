An educational repository of common problems and their solutions in dynamic programming methods and techniques,
including prerequisites (approaches of greedy, brute-force (iterative, recursive and state-space search) and binary
search), for competitive programmers. Also, I attached a sheet of problems from several online judges (basic problems
and extra) in details; difficulty, topics, hints and notes, in case you needed to solve.

I tried my best to make my code clean and readable. Also, I made comments for unclear statements, as possible. I wish
this will be helpful! Thank you!
